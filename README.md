This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# This is currently not a real template

I currently struggle to rename the project after pull.

If you want to use this Template then follow this installation steps:

- create React Native App
- Add two files to the root: .npmrc and .nvmrc
- Upgrade package.json with engine locking
- Implement Husky to run lint and test automaticly when saving via github
- Implement Commitlint and add to Husky
- Optional: add Vscode settings
- Implement NativeWind for Tailwindcss styling.
